- v1.3.1
   - New
      - feat: implement RFC 8482 handling for ANY queries
   - Changed
      - Refactoring Nameserver logic
         - fix deadlock: notify waitgroup before sending error to channel
      - Updated dependencies

- v1.3.0
   - New
      - Implemented DNS over TLS (DoT)
         - Added `general/dot_listen` and `general/tls_cert_filepath` and `general/tls_key_filepath` configuration options to [config.cfg](/config.cfg).
         - NOTE: You need manually specify the path to the wildcard certificate file in config. Because issuing wildcard certificates using "certmagic" appears to be difficult, acme-dns does not support automatic certificate renewal for DoT; you must obtain a wildcard certificate using other means, such as [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh).
            - At this point, it's unlikely that any CA will use DoT/DoQ/DoH, so this shouldn't be an issue.
      - Implemented DNS over QUIC (DoQ)
         - Added `general/enable_doq` and `general/doq_listen` configuration options to [config.cfg](/config.cfg).
         - This implementation is intended to be [RFC9250](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9250) compliant.
         - NOTE: DoQ must be enabled `general/enable_doq` in the config and will function with DoT enabled.
      - **NOTE: Since CA do not use DoT/DoQ to verify DNS-01 challenges, this feature is practically redundant for the core purpose of acme-dns.** It was implemented primarily out of personal curiosity and for experimental purposes.
   - Changed
      - Refactoring Logging logic
         - Add value `both` (stdout+file) for `logconfig/logtype` configuration option.
      - Refactoring Nameserver logic
         - fix:  handler registration bug by using per-server ServeMux.
         - feat: Enforce Read/Write timeouts for nameserver.

- v1.2.1
   - Tiny Fixed: Dockerfile for sqlite driver error
      - NOTE: If you see 'unknown driver "sqlite"' error at runtime, run: docker compose build --no-cache

- v1.2.0
   - Changed
      - Refactoring DNS response logic
         - Refactor DNS response handling to correctly populate the Authority section.
         - Ensure REFUSED is returned for out-of-zone queries.
      - Added context support for gracefull shotdown.
      - Added config check and validation logic.
         - NOTE: if you specify a path to a configuration file with the "-c" command line option, there is no fallback.
